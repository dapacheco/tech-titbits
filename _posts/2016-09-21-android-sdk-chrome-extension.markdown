I can't believe I hadn't come across this Chrome extension before but it
sure is helpful when digging into the Android SDK.

[Android SDK Search](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/android-sdk-search/hgcbffeicehlpmgmnhnkjbjoldkfhoin?hl=en)

> Adds an 'ad' omnibox command and view source links for the Android SDK.

Once you have it installed you can now type `ad` into the Chrome location bar, press `space` and then enter the keyword that you want to search the SDK for.

Additionally, when browsing the SDK you now have access to view the source.
